## #rambleramble
Like it says on the tin. A combination of a javascript implementation [Conway's Game of life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life), projected onto isometric space(via [beam](http://github.com/threepointone/beam), [iso-grid](https://github.com/threepointone/iso-grid)). All the cubes are rendered with css (transforms and what not). Also a place to experiment with [exponential smoothing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing) animation algorithms.

Demo: [http://threepointone.github.com/iso-gol/](http://threepointone.github.com/iso-gol/) - Glider guns!

Nice. I'll soon add user interactivity to add your own cubes.
